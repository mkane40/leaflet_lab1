Japan and United States of America were added to provide additional information outside of the region.  Moving through time shows a sharp decline in average fertility rate bring it to about 2.5 today.  Rates have halved just within the last 50 years.  Why is this happening? One, empowerment/success of women in society.  Two, increased care and well-being of children (Roser, 2014).  An article by James Gallagher, "Fertility rate: 'Jaw-dropping' global crash in children being born," describes a world in which populations in many countries will fall to half (refer to figure below.
